# multiple-linear-regression
This is my first practice on multiple linear regression using a dataset from kaggle, the dataset is in the repo. Built a regression model for an e-commerce startup using some variables to prdict the yearly spend. There are 8 columns in total in the dataset. Happy Machine Learing!
